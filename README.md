## Gitlab Fireshop

Fireshop is a webshop built on [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and
the [Angular](https://angular.io/) framework.

It should always only include changes specific to gitlab. Everything 
else should be added to the github project and pulled to this one instead. 

## Feature Branches
